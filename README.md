# Sailfish Camera app

## Issue reporting

Please report issues to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sailfishos/issue-tracker/issues) repository and
label issues with camera. You can also filter by [label](https://github.com/sailfishos/issue-tracker/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acamera).
There is also [droidmedia repository](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/issues) where you can report
issues that are closer to the Camera hardware adaptation but generic issues should go
to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sailfishos/issue-tracker/issues).

Worth noting that GitHub Issues provides a bug report template when creating a new issue.

Find more information from [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sailfishos/issue-tracker).


Happy hacking.
